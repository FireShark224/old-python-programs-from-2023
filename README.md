Hello! Fireshark224 here, i just wanted to tell you that all of those programs that are in this github repository.
Are all simple python programs i made back in late 2023, i am currently trying to get back into python programming.
So i can get better at python and make some actual useful projects in the future, and then release those projects under the GNU general public license v3.
Anyways, if those programs will be of any use to you then i will be happy.
